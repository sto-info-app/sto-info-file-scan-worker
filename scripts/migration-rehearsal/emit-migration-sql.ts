/**
 * Writes out the SQL a migration would run, without touching a database.
 *
 * The migration is handed a query runner that records statements instead of
 * executing them, so this is exactly what TypeORM would send — not a
 * transcription of it. The two files it produces are then replayed against a
 * throwaway PostgreSQL container by `run-rehearsal.sh`.
 *
 * The backend has its own copy of this, and the duplication is deliberate.
 * Neither repository can import from the other, and a rehearsal that needed
 * a sibling checkout to be present would be a rehearsal nobody ran.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register \
 *     scripts/migration-rehearsal/emit-migration-sql.ts \
 *     src/database/migrations/<migration>.ts <up.sql> <down.sql>
