### Git hooks

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) installs two hooks when you run
`npm install`:

- **`pre-commit`** ([.husky/pre-commit](.husky/pre-commit)) runs
  [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) over the files you
  have staged. Staged TypeScript gets `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write`, so
  formatting and import order are corrected in place and restaged. Import order
  is enforced rather than advisory — the lint-test workflow runs
  `npm run format:check` as its own step — so let the hook order your imports
  instead of arranging them by hand.
- **`commit-msg`** ([.husky/commit-msg](.husky/commit-msg)) requires a
  `Signed-off-by` trailer on every commit. Use `git commit -s`, or add the line
  yourself. DCO is also enforced in CI by the
  [DCO workflow](.github/workflows/dco.yml).

Write hook scripts as bare commands: no shebang, and no
`. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"` line. Husky invokes them through `.husky/_/h`
with `sh -e` and already puts `node_modules/.bin` on `PATH`. Both lines are
deprecated in husky 9 and will break the hook in husky 10.

To skip the hooks for a single commit — rarely a good idea — use
`git commit --no-verify`.

### Formatting

Prettier owns the layout of the TypeScript sources, including import order. To
check or apply it without committing:

```sh
npm run format:check   # verify, changing nothing
npm run format         # apply
```

`format:check` runs as its own step in the
[lint-test workflow](.github/workflows/lint-test.yml), so unformatted code fails
the build rather than being quietly corrected.

## Testing

Please ensure that your changes do not break any existing tests and add new tests for new features.

Coverage is enforced at 100% of statements, branches, functions and lines
([jest.config.mjs](jest.config.mjs)). The exclusions are listed there and are
the same set the backend uses: modules, entities, DTOs, enums, constants,
migrations and the entry point. A new file that is none of those needs tests.

```sh
npm run test           # the suite
npm run test:cov       # the suite with coverage, as CI runs it
npm run test:mutation  # Stryker, full
```

Thank you for your contributions!

## Troubleshooting

### `npm install` or `npm audit` fails with `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`

Some antivirus or internet-security software (e.g. Norton Web/Mail Shield, Avast, Kaspersky) performs HTTPS inspection — it intercepts SSL traffic and re-signs certificates with its own CA. That CA is trusted by Windows, but not by Node.js's built-in certificate bundle, so Node.js rejects the connection.

You can confirm this is the cause by running:

```sh
node -e "require('https').get('https://registry.npmjs.org', r => console.log(r.socket.getPeerCertificate().issuer))"
```

If the `CN` in the output is your security software (e.g. `Norton Web/Mail Shield Root`) rather than a standard CA (DigiCert, Let's Encrypt, etc.), apply the fix below.

**Fix:** Tell Node.js to use the Windows system certificate store, which already trusts your security software's CA. Set this once as a persistent user environment variable:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("NODE_OPTIONS", "--use-system-ca", "User")
```

Then open a new terminal — the setting takes effect immediately for all subsequent Node.js processes, including `npm`.

> This flag (`--use-system-ca`) requires Node.js 24 or later. GitHub Actions runners are unaffected because they connect to the npm registry directly without any SSL interception.
